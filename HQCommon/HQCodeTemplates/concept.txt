Copy & paste & tailoring often results in simpler source code that is therefore
easier to understand than using a cumbersome API aimed at serving all use cases.

But such code templates need to evolve, too: bug fixes and subtle improvements
are very useful to them.

This folder is designed to share (and evolve) such code templates and fixes and
improvements.
The routines here should be as concise and dependency-free as possible.

Most of these routines are compiled into (and are therefore present in)
HQCommon.dll readily consumable in binary form, too. This should be preferred
over copy & paste when no modification is necessary. But copy & paste is
preferred over further elaborating these routines here.
