<!--Also, keep in mind that unless you're serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml - which virtually no one actually is - then you're not actually using XHTML. It doesn't matter even if your doctype says XHTML. If you serve it as text/html, then the browser is treating it as plain old HTML, and all those self-closing slashes aren't really doing anything at all.-->
<!--However, XHTML never really caught on. Professional developers (especially those who were integrating programming languages like JavaScript and PHP into their web projects) loved XHTML Strict but it was a little too unforgiving for most developers, and the vast majority of pages never bothered to validate to the new standards. When the time came to devise a new standard, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) decided to support HTML5 rather than XHTML 2.-->
